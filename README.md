So I made some apps that tell you when somone opens a file, you can use it to protect one or just for fun, YOU NEED TO CHANGE THE WEBHOOK URL IN "WEBHOOK_HERE"!! It will send a message to discord. I put all aps in a multi-tool but you can just take one, or see what they do,
they are really fun!
It lets you know when someone's nosing around your files, adding a touch of excitement to your digital life. Now, these apps aren't just child's play â€“ they're a wild mix of simplicity and complexity. Want to mess around with a keylogger? It's in there too. Because why not? 
Dive in, have some fun, and remember, the only rule is there are no rules. Stay in Developer Mode.
