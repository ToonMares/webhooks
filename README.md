So I made some apps that tell you when somone opens a file, you can use it to protect one or just for fun, YOU NEED TO CHANGE THE WEBHOOK URL IN "WEBHOOK_HERE"!! It will send a message to discord. (YOU WILL NEED TO CREATE A WEBHOOK IN YOUR OWN SERVER!!!) I put all aps in a multi-tool but you can just take one, or see what they do, they are really fun!
It lets you know when someone's nosing around your files, adding a touch of excitement to your digital life. Now, these apps aren't just child's play â€“ they're a wild mix of simplicity and complexity. Want to mess around with a keylogger? It's in there too. Because why not? ALSO PLEASE DO IT ON YOURSELF OR ON SOMEONE WHO GAVE YOU PERMISSION!!!

!!!PLEASE USE THIS JUST FOR ETHICAL HACKING!!!

also the first and the last will create files, the first will save screenshots, locally and the last one will save the key-logs. SO MAKE SURE TO NOT PUT IT ON DESKTOP OR JUST CREATE A SHORTCUT!!
